### Jenkins in docker on centos7

```
Here is simple exemple of jenkins on docker with reverse proxy. 
The revers proxy working with SSL selfsigned cert.

Uncommit the certbot section in docker compose file and use letsencript autorized certificate. 

The privalaged mode of containers not necessary.  

Great solution to fast jenkins mashine.
